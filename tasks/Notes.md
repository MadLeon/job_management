I'm writing a next.js, redux and sqlite ethernet app. guide me by steps. The first thing I want to do is to set up a dev environment, including db file connect, and then I want to publish a test app, in which I can update daily, so that I can let ppl know the dev progress. It would be better if every git push can update the temp app.



first give me git command to pull the newly created git repo, named job_management from GitHub

=ROUND(RAND()*(0.094-0.093)+0.093,3)
Format Cells → Number → Custom: [<1].000;0.000

=RIGHT(TEXT(ROUND(RAND() * (0.2788 - 0.2771) + 0.2773, 4), "0.0000"), 5)

### DIR Work Process

0. Check if all files are there.
1. Type in the drawing # and job # for convenience later.
2. Search if it's already exists.
3. If not exists, find a most recent existing one, then Save AS a new file.
4. Delete other work sheets if exists, change page #.
5. Fill in the title

   * Description (last line above drawing #)
   * Material -> ask if not sure
   * Cast # / Heat #

     * McMaster		McM # 8703k62 (McM+space+#+space+highlight) highlight = first line of product or Lot (e.g. 0093408457)
     * LB ALUMINIUM	Analysis Ref. (bottom right)

   * Job #
   * OE # - top left of pink card
   * PO #
   * QTY
   * Signature \& date (MTR)
   * Order of items - from FRONT VIEW then SIDE VIEWS, from TOP LEFT then clockwise

7. Check

   * The decimal place in Error column MUST match with the Actual value column
   * Preview - make sure all pages are the same

       * Page #
       * Item #
       * Outlines & borders are proper
       * Thread Gauge text is centered

   * Erase all added pencil marks, check values

Ask for

* stamp \& make sure the measurement tool to use.
* material to use
* specific tolerance if not sure

Note:

* Tolerance's range is like (1, 2]
* Drawing \& Actual Dimension - shrink to fit (if too long)
* Error will occur if Drawing \& Actual Dimension are the same, delete it
* Plug \& ring gauge

  * UNC 3B fit for 2B
  * 2B as default
  * If there is a 3B, use 3B, otherwise, use 2B

* Venier caliper (S-2144)
* Write 2 lines if chanpher
* Critical tolerance 76.08/76.00 (0.00/-0.08)
* OM shows up in GD \& T, the tolerance is Dynamic, check (Candu 147-31972-0182-01-DD-C @72320	2025.9.9)
* If a number is range, then random pick one.
* If a number / a group of numbers is circled, it means ok. 

  * You can fill in a random # WITHIN the range of tolerance. (Dewang)
  * Use +- 0.5 for degrees if there is no specification.
  * Use surface profiles for tolerance. (Franco)

Vernier Caliper: For tolerance > 0.004

### Bubble Drawing Conditions

Candu & RT	Bubble Drawing
ATS / BWXT	Bubble Drawing \& DIR	ATS only bubble for critical tolerance
Kinectrik	No Bubble Drawing

Note:

1. Omit if bracket/enclose(square) exists
2. ATS only bubble for critical tolerance (specified tolerance) and GD\&T
3. If there is only 1 bubble for a chamfer, which has 2 values (.03 X 45degree), use the number for 2 values.
4. Category: A (whole dimension: all numbers), B & B1 (critical dimension: a number with its own tolerance)

**Discus**

1. New TDP - Add Drawing - G:/$'CompanyName' - find pdf file 
   - check for plot data, make sure the drawing and pdf are the same
2. Add bubble & sub-bubble, change size/color (green) 
3. Save Discus file !! Add Job #
4. Export PDF file !! Add Job #

---

### Material

1. Check the Drawing page.
2. Check Manufacturing Process page.
3. Check MTR page.

Note: Ask if 2 \& 3 are not match.

---

### How to make a GD\&T

1. Drawing Folder -> find the drawing file
2. Snippet Tool -> cut the area
3. Copy to the DIR

### Tolerance

1. Use FRACTIONS tolerance for integers, in general. If rejected, use 1 PLACE DEC. If still rejected, try to modify the #, after asking for permission. 

---

### Short Terms

DIR	Dimension Inspection Report
DWR	Drawing (Bubble/Assembly Drawing)
MTR	Mill Testing Report
GD\&T	Geometric Dimension \& Tolerance

### Problems

See Word document.
