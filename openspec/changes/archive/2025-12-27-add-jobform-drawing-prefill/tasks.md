## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Add part_number blur call to /api/drawings/detail to retrieve revision and description.
- [x] 1.2 Apply returned revision/description only when fields are empty; keep user-entered values unchanged.
- [x] 1.3 Preserve existing drawing-file-location lookup and keep failures silent without blocking user input.
- [x] 1.4 Add verification (reasoned code path review; manual runtime check recommended for found/missing/error cases).
