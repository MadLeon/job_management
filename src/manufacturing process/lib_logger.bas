'/**
' * Logger Module (lib_logger.bas)
' * 
' * Description:
' *  - Write all debug, error, and info messages to mp_log.txt file
' *  - File location: Same directory as Manufacturing Process.xlsm
' *  - Log format: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [Category] Message content
' *  - Block-based logging: logs are buffered and written as complete blocks
' *  - New blocks are inserted at the beginning of file (newest first)
' *  - Lines within a block are in chronological order (earliest first)
' *  - Blocks are separated by blank lines
' * 
' * Usage:
' *  1. Call StartLogBlock() at the beginning of an operation
' *  2. Call LogDebug/LogError/LogInfo() during operation (buffered)
' *  3. Call FlushLogBlock() at end of operation to write entire block to file
